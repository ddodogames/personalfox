# personalfox
A custom firefox user.js for my needs to make ESR less insufferable

## Why?
I'm one of those guys that used to have Firefox as a second browser after Chrome/Chromium. I always used main release until one day i switched to ESR for stablity and for the sake of not facing nonsense suddenly for a long period of time. On one faithful day, ESR 140 dropped but it came with stupid issue which would freeze my system after just opening a few tabs.

Eventually, after a battle of trying to make it usable, i learned about user.js stuff and thus personalfox was born! This was mainly made so that i can apply all of my personal changes with just one file to make ESR usable for me (the file is currently targeted at 140 ESR but might update it for the next ESR if i kept using Firefox).
